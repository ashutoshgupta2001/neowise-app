## API TASK

Implement a transaction API for enabling fund transfers between users.

### SUBTASK 1: Database Design

-   You will use MySQL as your choice of database for this assignment.
-   Create a script for database creation. It should be possible to set up the DB with a single terminal command.
-   Load a `users` table from `spec/users.json` with a load script. You can use any language for this (python, js, shell, etc) but it must be automated.
-   The `transactions` table should have valid {senderId, receiverId}. Both these values should belong to valid users.

### SUBTASK 2: Retrieve a transaction

`GET: /api/transactions/<transactionId>`

-   Returns transaction information for a given transaction Id. Check `spec/transaction.json` for the transaction format.

### SUBTASK 3: Retrieve all transactions

`GET: /api/transactions/`

-   Returns all transactions [list of `spec/transaction.json`]

### SUBTASK 4: Create a new transaction

`POST: /api/transactions/`

-   Creates a new transaction.
-   Payload will contain `{senderId, receiverId, amount, details}`.
-   Transaction Id will be autogenerated on the backend - **should be uuid!**.
-   Validate the transaction to check if the balance is sufficient in the sender's account.
-   Store the transaction in the database.

### SUBTASK 5: Reverse a transaction

`DELETE: /api/transactions/<transactionId>`

-   Reverses a transaction and restores the sender's and receiver's balance accordingly.

### SUBTASK 6: Notify users involved in a transaction

-   Build a notification mechanism to notify both the users involved in a transaction. (You can implement a callback service, websocket etc)

NOTE: No actual communication is expected, a simple console.log() should work.

## FRONTEND TASK

Your task involves integrating the provided REST APIs with a frontend interface to enable users to interact with the transaction system seamlessly. Below are the specific requirements for each view:

### SUBTASK 1: View Transaction Details

-   Display detailed information about a specific transaction when provided with its ID.

### SUBTASK 2: View All Transactions

-   Present a list of all transactions, allowing users to browse through them conveniently.

### SUBTASK 3: Create New Transaction

-   Design a form or interface that enables users to initiate a new transaction by specifying the sender, receiver, amount, and details.

### SUBTASK 3: Reverse Transaction

-   Implement functionality to reverse a transaction, ensuring that appropriate balances are restored for both the sender and receiver.

Ensure that the frontend is user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing. You may utilize React.JS to accomplish this task.

## Notes

-   Cache data for `GET` endpoints for faster retrival of the data from the server. Cache should be updated to avoid stale data.
-   You will be evaluated on the basis of code quality - namely code structure, variable and function names, and separation of responsibilities between files.
-   You can design your database schemas with appropriate data types and keep in mind that queries should be easy to write.
-   Feel free to make any assumptions if you feel we have not mentioned something but make sure you inform us about them during the time of submission.

## Submission

-   Create a GitHub repository for this task.
-   Each change should be submitted in the form of well-labeled commits.
-   Include this README in your repository and add an additional section describing the steps required to run the code.
-   Give read access to (https://github.com/prithvisharma & https://github.com/andre-fernando) to review the assignment.
